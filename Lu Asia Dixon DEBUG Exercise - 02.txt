Here is the correct pseudocode:

// All employees have a standard $45 deduction from their checks.
// If an employee does not earn enough to cover the deduction
// an error message is displayed.

      num gross
      num net

   output "Enter first name or ", EOFNAME, " to quit"
   input name

Explanation of Changes:

Corrected Data Type for DEDUCTION: Changed DEDUCTION from a string to a number (num DEDUCTION = 45) 
to allow for arithmetic operations.

Replaced while Loop with if-else: The original code had a while net > 0 loop, which would result in 
an infinite loop since the net value doesn't change within the loop. I replaced it with an if-else 
statement to check whether the net pay is greater than zero, and output the corresponding message.

Loop for Multiple Employees: Added a while loop to continuously prompt for employee details until the
 user enters EOFNAME. This allows the program to handle multiple employees.

Correct Input/Output Flow: Ensured that after processing each employee, the program correctly prompts for
 the next employee's details, or quits if EOFNAME is entered.
