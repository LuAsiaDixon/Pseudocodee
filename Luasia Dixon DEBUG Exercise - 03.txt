Explanation of Changes:
Added Input for firstTest:

Before entering the while loop, the program now prompts for the firstTest score to initialize the loop properly.
Corrected Average Calculation:

Parentheses are added around (firstTest + secondTest) to ensure the correct calculation before division by 2.
Fixed output Typo:

The misspelled ouput is corrected to output for proper syntax.
Loop Input Correction:

After completing one iteration of the loop, the program now prompts again for the firstTest score to decide 
whether to continue or exit the loop. Without this, the program could enter an infinite loop.
Logical Use of While Loop:

The while condition correctly uses <> (not equal to) to continue the loop until the user inputs 0.
